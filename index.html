                        Harry James Potter is a fictional character and the titular protagonist in J. K. Rowling's
                        series of eponymous novels.
                        The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his
                        eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard.
                        Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to practise magic under the guidance
                        of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best
                        friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
                        Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and
                        that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort - the internationally feared Dark Wizard and
                        murderer of his parents, Lily and James.
                        The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and
                        defeat Voldemort.

                        Harry is regarded as a fictional icon and has been described by many critics, readers, and
                        audiences as one of the greatest literary and film characters of all time.
                        He is portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe in all eight Harry Potter films from Philosopher's Stone
                        (2001) to Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011).

                        The Sorting Hat was a sentient magical hat at Hogwarts that determined which of the four school
                        Houses each new student belonged most to. These four Houses were Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,
                        Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the
                        four founders of Hogwarts.It normally stayed in the Headmaster's office until it was needed

                    <p>
                        Quidditch (formerly known as Kwidditch and Cuaditch) was a wizarding sport played on
                        broomsticks.It was the most popular game and most well-known game among wizards and witches,
                        and, according to Rubeus Hagrid, the equivalent to Muggles' passion for football (Soccer)

                    <p>King's Cross Station in London. Magically concealed behind the barrier between Muggle Platforms
                        Nine and Ten, this Platform was where Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry students
                        boarded the Hogwarts Express every 1 September, in order to attend school.
                        In order for someone to get onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, they had to walk directly at
                        the apparently solid barrier dividing Platforms Nine and Ten.When returning from Platform Nine
                        and Three-Quarters, there was a guard stationed just outside the ticket barrier, in order to
                        regulate exits from the platform through the gate, in order to not alarm the Muggles.

                    <p>The Golden Snitch was originally not a ball, but a little magical bird called a Golden Snidget.
                        It was introduced in 1269, when the Chief of the Wizards' Council, Barberus Bragge, unleashed a
                        Golden Snidget during a Quidditch match, offering a reward of 150 Galleons to the player who
                        caught the Snidget.</p>

                        "The Mirror of Erised is an ancient, ornate mirror. It has clawed feet and a gold frame
                        inscribed with the phrase "Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi". The mirror shows the
                        most desperate desire of a person's heart, a vision that has been known to drive men mad."

                        "Only a minority of trees can produce wand quality wood (just as a minority of humans can
                        produce
                        magic). It takes years of experience to tell which ones have the gift, although the job is made
                        easier if Bowtruckles are found nesting in the leaves, as they never inhabit mundane trees."
                        Various types of wood were used in the construction of wands. Once carved into the appropriate
                        shape, the wood was embedded with a core of a magical substance, which might be chosen
                        specifically
                        to match the type of wood in question. Wands could vary significantly in length — from a minimum
                        of
                        7" to at least 16" — and come in varying degrees of rigidity, including "springy","flexible",
                        "supple" and "unyielding"
